Answering the whats and hows of electricty and magnetism while leaving the learner yearning for more, this course introduces the Mathematical pre-requisites for EM (Gauss' and Stokes' theorems) and covers electrostatics, magnetostatics, electromagnetic induction and the Maxwell equations. It also gives a peek into how this applies to wave propagation.
