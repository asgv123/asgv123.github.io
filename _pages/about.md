Hi there! 🙋‍♂️
Dec 14, 2024
I'm still working on my website, but here's a basic intro for now.
I hope to remove this note by Feb 2, 2025 ^^

I’m Andrews. I'm a <??? I don't think I have a single phrase to sum my interests. Yet>. 

I currently work at Samsung Electronics where I design high-performance algorithms for 5G networks. At IIT, I was part of team AUV-IITB's software division before becoming team lead. I had the pleasure to work with some brilliant minds over there who are now my closest friends. I have also explored quite a bit of RL through courses and projects, and have recently been building my intuition through self-study. I aim to work at the intersection of RL, systems and robotics, using each other's insights to create a greater whole.

In the long(er) term, I would like to bring education and opportunities to more and more students across the world irrespective of their backgrounds. This could be through my own work in tech, through teaching, or through financial contributions. A bit of each would be the best.

In my free time, I enjoy cooking, hiking, swimming and trading.

Reach out to me any time, preferably by email or Instagram (same handle as GitHub). I'm always up for exciting conversations.
