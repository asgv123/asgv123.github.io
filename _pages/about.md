Hi there! üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I‚Äôm Andrews George Varghese, an engineer and researcher passionate about reinforcement learning (RL) and robotics. I graduated with honors from Indian Institurte of Technology(IIT) Bombay in Electrical Engineering, with a minor in Computer Science. My academic and professional journey has been driven by a deep curiosity to explore how intelligent systems learn and adapt.

Currently, I work at Samsung Electronics, where I design high-performance algorithms for 5G networks. I have lead the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle team at IITB. My research spans applications of RL in autonomous systems and optimizing learning models for practical implementation. I aspire to advance RL and robotics research, focusing on building efficient and adaptive systems. 

My goal is to leverage my interdisciplinary skills to contribute to impactful innovations in RL, robotics, and systems design, ensuring a positive and lasting societal impact.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring intersections of technology with arts, finance, and music.
